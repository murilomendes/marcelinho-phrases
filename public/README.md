## :scroll: About
After years viewing crazy job and E pra hoje marcelinho? on social media, I've decided to merge them in a single website.


## :gem: Stack
This site is create using [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) (ES6) and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). It uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I'm using [npm](https://npmjs.com) as the package manager.

> Oh but why not creating it with React or Vue?
>> Because I didn't want to :smile:


## :pencil: Contributing
You can contribute to this project following the steps below:

- Fork the repo
- Create a new branch
- Do the work
- Fill a PR, assign it to you and, if possible, write a cool description
- Wait for the review

Also, take a look at the [contributing guide](https://github.com/jlozovei/developer-titles/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)!

After that, if your request doesn't offend anyone, your title will be able to be part of the great array.

**Don't be afraid to fill some issues, if you want! :heart:**

> For the colors, I like to use [colorion](http://colorion.co).

If you're only looking for the titles, [here they are](https://github.com/jlozovei/developer-titles/blob/master/src/data/titles.json). :rocket:


## :computer: Developing
After forking and cloning the project in your local environment, run the following commands:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm i
# or yarn

# run the project at localhost:9000
npm start
# or yarn start
```

To add a new title, go to [`src/data/titles.json`](https://github.com/jlozovei/developer-titles/blob/master/src/data/titles.json) and add a new title object to the array. It's important the title to have, at least, the `name` key - because if the title hasn't a name, then it shouldn't be here; `background`, `color` and `credits` keys are optional.

Here's how a new title object should look:

```json
{
  "name": "Your title name",
  "background": "Your title hex background",
  "color": "Your title hex background",
  "credits": {
    "name": "Who you want to credit (name, nick or slug)",
    "url": "The person's profile URL (linkedin, github...)"
  }
}
```
