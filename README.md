## :scroll: About
After years viewing crazy job and E pra hoje marcelinho? on social media, I've decided to merge them in a single website.


## :gem: Stack
This site is create using [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) (ES6) and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). It uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I'm using [npm](https://npmjs.com) as the package manager.

> Oh but why not creating it with React or Vue?
>> Because I didn't want to :smile:
